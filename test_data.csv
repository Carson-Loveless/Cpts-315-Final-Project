Nits and Appreciation from Robert Steele

1)  Second ranking civilian:  at the time there were about 25 civilians in Marine Corps intelligence.  The top person was John Guenther, an SES-6 who had been there forever.  I was the second, as a GM-14.  All others were GS-09 to GS-13.  It is an accurate fact.

2)  On the Drug War film, I did not volunteer.  The film producer got in touch with me because of my Amazon reviews, eg. LOST HISTORY on contras, drugs, and CIA, and asked if I could come to Los Angeles for filming.  I agreed provided he would pay my expenses, which he did, and I volunteered my time.

3)  The COLLECTIVE INTELLIGENCE book is my first book to be published that does not have my name on the cover.  I am turning now toward nurturing and aggregating others and although I have three chapters in this book, recommend it be listed.

If anyone wants to engage in dialog leading to improvements of this page (for example, my three most recent seminal articles on OSINT are at www.oss.net/OSINT-S, www.oss.net/OSINT-O, and at www.oss.net/HILL where my article on """"The Open Source Program: Missing in Action"""" is being read by virtually everyone either planning to attend or deciding not to attend the DNI OSINT conference

I also wrote the Joint Military Intelligence Training Center Open Source Handbook, and the Special Operations Forces Open Source Handbook, as well as the NATO Open Source Handbook, and will create stubs for the first two, should anyone wish to link to them.

"efa6836dcc6a97d5","Topic ban violation and sock puppetry
Hello. You had some interaction with IP  in connection with the Golan Heights  so accordingly, I am notifying you and Stifle of a matter that is of serious concern.
 
I have reason to believe that this IP user is Nableezy trying to circumvent a topic ban imposed on him by Stifle. The ban forbids him from editing or commenting on the Golan Heights and all areas of Israel and its environs including cities, settlements and regions.
 
The IP in question geolocates to Chicago  and the edit in question is consistent with Nableezy’s POV.  Prior to the instant edits, the IP never made any edits to the topic area and the first edit that he makes in the topic area is to The Golan Heights. 

Nableezy is also from Chicago as evidenced from his early Trait Page
 
But there is more. The subject IP also made edits to a hockey article involving players in the NHL. Nableezy has expressed more than a passing interest for this subject as evidenced by this 
 
But the similarities between the IP user and nableezy do not end there. The subject IP made this edit on a very technical subject involving circuitry and electronics. 
 
Nableezy attended Illinois Institute of Technology, a school that emphasizes engineering and IT evidenced by his early Trait List 
 
So now we have an IP who, like Nableezy, comes from Chicago with interests in the Golan Heights, Hockey and IT. The coincidences are too great to ignore per WP:DUCK. The evidence suggests that The IP is Nableezy's sock puppet used to circumvent Stifle's topic ban.",0,0,0,0,0,0

 Hi Peter, I'll look into this bug shortly. I will run a trace of your classifications and see if, indeed, some of the revisions do show up twice. This is pretty core functionality for something to go wrong and unnoticed for so long  although maybe it is specific to the WikiTrust queue  which does not see a lot of use. This is the user-name you were using? And you logged in with the same user-name both times, right?
 Can you describe what the scrolling issue is? I fret this could be a tougher fix  its not like I actually implement scrolling, this is just something Java provides. 
 Also, you'll generally find that the accuracy of classifications among the queues looks like """"Cluebot-NG > STiki > WikiTrust"""" (assuming everything is working correctly).

Her mother is a professional and has worked for the government for almost 30 years and her father is retired.   Traci was raised on staage at the age of 2 starting with ballet then tap, then jazz.... she was a natural on stage..... throughout her childhood she was in pagaents and sport like softball, volleyball and track in high school, she competed in many events: Miss Wright State of OHIO,All American Drill Team.

After Traci graduated, her love of dance and people took her to a business college, where she studied basics in business management.  Then she learned ins and outs of banking and later took on another degree in Medical Techology. She also did promotional work for , bartended , ran local bars and competed in bikini contests for extra funds.

In 1996, Traci started lifting weights with a friend and saw a photo of Marla Duncan winning a national competition. Her beauty and physique impressed her enough that she wanted to try what she was doing - Fitness Competitions. At the time she was developing some problems medically and noticed herself gaining some weight.   Traci thought weight training would help but she found that because she is a natural she responded almost imediately to the weights which caused her to get pretty stocky and very strong quick.  She was still eating normally but when it comes to bikini contests you need to be lean and feminine.... well this is when the Army Soldiers took a noticed to her.  She was at Ft. Hood, TX and was left alone because a lot of times soldiers are away for months to years and she was pretty shy meeting others because she had always been very much independent.  So she decided to check out while in studies some competitions related to the Army.  This is where she found out about obstacles course contests... so she knew she was strong and stocky so maybe this would be better for her.  So she entered her first WTF competition with little or know training and out of 100 girls made nationals in top 10. but something happened ... she started noticing her weight wasn't changing and she was developing back problems and fatigue.   She had always had problems with being healthy as a kid and seemed to get sick a lot.  Her Father was always on her about bundling up.  One day her discomfort and taken so much that she ended up in the emergency room... this is when she found that her bowels had backed up into her system and she was lucky because if was really serious... the only time she had ever dealt with hospitals is with her hearing... she had lost her hearing at four along with being sick all the time... and at 17 had to have implants put in which was a miracle cause it gave her 80% back... but she is still considered hearing impaired... now this is happening to her... she had gained a weight up to 180 and looked very stocky... the doctors didn't know what was wrong with her.... she spent three days being detoxed so to speak... when they didn't know if she had lupus, rheumatoid, but later found traces of cancer in her colon... but she didn't let it get her down. So she reenrolled in school again for more college degrees towards nutrition in NC.   Up until 2002 she only competed for fun, not as a money making career. In 2002 she was honored with several titles in many organizations like Hawaiian Tropic, Venus, Ms Fitness and Sport Aerobics and WTF.. it wasn't til she had heard she was on ESPN2 every month for one year and honored on the front page of her local newspaper and found herself in several articles in OXYGEN. This helped Traci realize that she had potential to earn some actual money in the fitness industry. She kept competing and in April of '2002 moved to an organization which she had heard was tough and very different from others called NPC /IFBB.  This is where Arnold S. Slyvester Stalone and many more came out of you know the BOYS CLUB Once she arrived, competing in her first NPC she had found a very different way they handled threi shows and treated the competitors... Shoop coming from a strong female in charge background family life saw that this was going to be a challenge for her... she had dreamed of maybe getting more exposure and getting the chance to really be friends with some of the hollywood celebrities.  During the time she was studying nutriiton she always had more than several ideas and projects in mind to bring to the future.... now she has alwsy felt competing natural was always her best route and found with no help and little support she was able to conquer her enemies and achieve her goals.  She was always wnadering why thes other girls who seemed to get covers and major sponsors did it... where she found herself funding everything on her little $7 an hour because she as a military spouse never made as much in those cities because the husband was the provider she was tired of the little she wanted bigger she knew that s",0,0,0,0,0,0

 To be honest, I think that this is a fair comment. Accordingly, (and as this is a much debated article), I would like to propose this revised opening paragraph:
The terms Old Style (or O.S.) and New Style (or N.S.) are used in English language historical studies to indicate that the dating system used in the source material is one or other of the (historic) methods for determining the day on which the year starts. In the Old Style dating, the year began on 25 March, whereas in the New Style it began on 1 January.Death warrant of Charles I web page of the UK National Archives A demonstration of New Style meaning Julian calendar with a start of year adjustment. Additionally (more so in other parts of the world), the terms are used to indicate the change from the historic calendar [for example, the Julian calendar in Europe and the Americas] to the (modern) Gregorian calendar.The October (November) Revolution Britannica encyclopaedia, A demonstration of New Style meaning the Gregorian calendar.Stockton, J.R. Date Miscellany I: The Old and New Styles """"The terms 'Old Style' and 'New Style' are now commonly used for both the 'Start of Year' and 'Leap Year' [(Gregorian calendar)] changes (England & Wales: both in 1752; Scotland: 1600, 1752). I believe that, properly and historically, the 'Styles' really refer only to the 'Start of Year' change (from March 25th to January 1); and that the 'Leap Year'  change should be described as the change from Julian to Gregorian.""""Spathaky, Mike Old Style New Style dates and the change to the Gregorian calendar.

We as historians have no excuse for creating ambiguity and must keep to the notation described above in one of its forms. It is no good writing simply 20th January 1745, for a reader is left wondering whether we have used the Old or the New Style reckoning. The date should either be written 20th January 1745 O.S. (if indeed it was Old Style) or as 20th January 1745/6. The hyphen (1745-6) is best avoided as it can be interpreted as indicating a period of time.""""

 VfD on Jews by country 

This has not yet been submitted, and John would wig out if I submitted it myself. But I suggest you discuss this with others ASAP. I submit for your discussion with others that the author has little regard for misrepresenting the reliability of his figures, that the article gives a inferior knowledge than the Jewish population article does both of current and pass population tends. That the title is questionable in its honesty because as he shows at the top of the discussion page, following his prevuious pattern he should have used the less offensive title Judaism by country. And finally, the figures which he has published do not come from the listed reference pages as he infers but have been generated by himself by multiplying the est. 2005 populations by the rough percentage numbers for the countries.

As an example, being Australian I checked his figure for """"Australian Jews"""" in his words. None of his references give his figure of 100,452. Nor do any of the reputable sources pretend to give percise religious numbers to six or eight digit accuracy. In fact, checking the references you quickly discover that the 2001 Australian census gave the figure of 84,000 people who marked Judaism as their religion. That all other real estimates are based upon adjustments to that figure, as is discussed on this page I found by a Christian Research Association. I finally did a Google searchon his claimed figure to discover that Wikipedia is the only publication claiming such a figure. So I finally submit that this article relects badly upon Wikipedia and adds no meaningful value beyond the fine work already done in Jewish population. I am afraid this is seems to be another example of where this author has misrepresented certain details to create the illusion that he is scholarly NPOV author. 17:32, 11 Feb 2005 (UTC)""",0,0,0,0,0,0

As Whitehouse observes, """"Wikipedia's strength is that it has thousands of eyes looking at it. The hope is that errors will be quickly caught and corrected."""".. Marketing professor Peter Fader notes that Wikipedia shows there is wisdom in crowds, but a better user rating system would filter out those who post bogus information. Joel Waldfogel, professor of business and public policy, agrees that much of the concern about Wikipedia is just a new spin on whether old media (printed encyclopedias, in this case) stand a chance against the new breed of instantly updatable online media. (quoted from article). In short, no matter what system you come up with here, it is going to be wisdom of the crowd, by design, that is what Wiki is.

I could be wrong here, but in Hitman: Blood Money, in that last cut-scene, just before Diana enters his hideout, the article assumes 47 kills the canary by snapping his neck. However, since this is done off screen, and also the canary is caged, my assumption was that 47 snapped his fingers and the canary stopped chirping.  This would seem to fit in with the fact that 47 takes care to take the cage with him out of harm's way when he hears someone coming.

Um, the Georg Blume quote obviously implies that he was inquiring about the reason for the riots. James Miles was there to report on the riots, so he would ask questions pertaining to the riots. If they actually wanted to separate, I can tell you right now that, logically, they would've TOLD THEM they wanted to and would say something to the effect of """"FREE US, WE WANT TO SEPARATE"""", but they did not. They just explained their issues, which were socioeconomic and ethnic issues. In addition, James Miles states: """"The rioting seemed primarily an eruption of ethnic hatred."""",which I'm guessing he had to interview many rioters/residents to ask them about it. And rather, I don't think the Rodney King article is worded very well- it should be changed, but I'm guessing many people are already well-informed of the real reasons for those riots, unlike this riot where few seem to understand- including you! And, come on now, you're obviously just picking at straws to try to twist the article. All evidence so far points to the rioters looting and beating ethnic Han chinese out of hatred, not because they want to separate or they would've attacked much more government buildings rathern than focussing on the stores of more wealthy Chinese people. Right now, the article is pretty neutral as it already explains both sides and I hope people keep it this way.216.252.71.154

Dear Ronz,

PSB the embedded links and the areas which I am trying to update: 

1. The multi-stage fitness test, also known as the bleep test, beep test, pacer test, Leger-test or 20-m shuttle run test, is used by sports coaches and trainers to estimate an athlete's VO2 max (maximum oxygen uptake). The test is especially useful for players of sports like rugby, soccer, Australian rules football, hockey, netball, handball, tennis, squash and fitness testing at schools and colleges plus many other sports; employed by many international sporting teams as an accurate test of Cardiovascular fitness, one of the all-important """"Components of Fitness"""". This test is also part of the FITNESSGRAM - Commercial Link, incorrect and unrelated to the Multi-stage Fitness Test physical fitness test to measure cardiorespiratory - Typo fitness. The test was created by Luc Leger, University of Montreal[1] published in 1983, """"A Maximal Multistage 20m Shuttle Run Test to predict VO2 Max"""", and was re-published in the European Journal of Applied Physiology (vol 49 pp 1–12) in 1988 in its present form with 1 min stages under the name """"Multistage 20-m shuttle run test for aerobic fitness"""".[2] Result equivalences between slightly modified versions are well explained by Tomkinson et al. in 2003.[3] The beep test world record is 19.2, held by Håkan Mild.[4][unreliable source?] - Embedded Commercial Link LAZYRUNNER added as Reference

2. The Multi-stage Fitness Test is know as both the beep test and bleep test, the broken links for the beep article are irrelevant to the content of the Multi-stage Fitness Test article as it discusses both.

I look forward to hearing from you via PM.

The grounds (as you put it) are WP:BLP. Gwen Gale (talk)  

The complaint is based on five points 
1/ Gwen Gale failed to follow proper policy with regard to deleting biographical material on living persons, viz. discussing it beforehand. The section had existed for some time, had been discussed and commented on extensively, and had been edited by several persons. As far as I am aware, Gwen Gale had no prior involvement in the page or the section concerned. Certainly, I had never seen her name in any of the page history. Unless it constituted a grave breach of some other policy, which not even Gwen Gale has claimed, any possible deletion should have been discussed beforehand and not executed summarily. To quote the BLP policy  “Biographical material about a living individual that is not compliant with this policy should be improved and rectified; if this is not possible, then it should be removed.”
No complaint about the nature of the material was made beforehand; no opportunity for improvement or rectification was offered. 
2/ Having failed to discuss it properly beforehand, Gwen Gale also failed to discuss it properly afterwards. She made a few general remarks, using terms which, as will be discussed later, do not form part of any Wikipedia policy, viz. “single sourced, anecdotal”, and breezily referred those who wanted to discuss the matter with her to general Wikipedia policy documents, such as Biography of Living Persons or Verifiability. As will be shown in what follows the text did not violate either of these policy documents. Gwen Gale refused multiple specific requests to quote the exact passages of the Biography on Living Persons or Verifiability policies which she claimed had been violated. This refusal to properly discuss a summary deletion is against Wikipedia conduct guidelines and not acceptable behaviour in an Administator.
3/ Gwen Gale’s comments on the summary deletion reveal that she does not understand the core Wikipedia policy on reliable sources.
4/ Gwen Gale’s comments indicate that she does not understand the proper scope of Wikipedia’s policy on Verifiability.
5/ Gwen Gale’s comments reveal that she does not understand Wikipedia’s Biography on Living Persons policy. 
The only serious grounds on which deletion of the deleted text could be justified is Weight. This is not the ground on which Gwen Gale chose to defend it. She repeatedly cited BLP and V as the core defence of her actions, demonstrating that her judgement is massively flawed and that her administrative powers should be revoked. The core issue here is not the content. The core issue is Gwen Gale’s conduct and judgement. The Weight issue will, however, be discussed at the end.

Gwen Gale’s Misunderstanding of the Wikipedia’s Guidelines on Reliable Sourcing
It is clear that Gwen Gale does not understand Wikipedia’s policy on sourcing. In stating that the claims embodied in the deleted text were “anecdotal”, she is effectively second-guessing the judgement of the original reliable source, viz. The Austin Chronicle. She is implicitly expressing the view that the Austin Chronicle’s assembled journalists, editors, sub-editors and lawyers made an error in judgement in publishing the article in the first place. This is completely unacceptable and represents a FUNDAMENTAL ERROR IN JUDGEMENT. It is in no way appropriate for Wikipedia editors to make their own subjective judgements about the editorial standards of highly reputable and professional publications. It is the equivalent of an editor disputing a reference to a professional academic journal on",0,0,0,0,0,0

Re-ill's mindset, """"I'm in a place in my life where I need to become who I am... I got to “Get It”!!! says E. Re-ill. “Get It” is an album that when focused on can bring out the drive in you to make your dreams real. Why you may ask? You need three things to achieve your goals Hope (expectations), Hustle (drive) and Hunger (appetite for success). These three mindsets are displayed in this album which accompanied by your dreams this will enable your inner being to ““Get It”!” E. Re-ill has been producing beats since the late 80's, influenced by Dr. Dre (and who isn't), Rick Rubin, performed with many stars, and has participated in great projects. A prior and classic venture was with the street-ball company Y.P.A. and the DVD titled """"The War"""". E. Re-ills’ most rememberable time in making music is when N.W.A. was filming the classic controversial video """"Straight Outta Compton"""" E. Re-ill's older brother caught the attention of Ice Cube and filmed Ice Cube telling E. Re-ill to keep up and he'll see him on top!!! That statement would drive E.Re-ill for many years.

Hip-Hop can be fun, dark, and everything in between. However, usually no matter the topic a hip-hop song it should captivate you!!! “Get It” is no exception to this, “Get It” displays emotional drive, creative sound packages, consistent vibe and sounds, and arguably some of the best lyrics delivered on hip-hop tracks in a long while. Songs like """"Dark People"""" a description of pushing your self to great heights even when life shorts you of opportunities. """"I'm So Gangsta"""" is a nice surprise!!!

Fresh Caesar displays lyrical strengths of Nas and Jay-Z with a west coast flavor delivery. Fresh Caesar displays great lyrical ability and is definitely not your average rapper on the mic.

Re-ill felt compelled to use the demos for the world to hear due to their strong delivery of life experiences. E.

I believe that the Clean Air Act trial is deserving of a separate section, given the potential enormous exposure that BP has and the fact that this trial will be ongoing, generating headlines, through next year. Some editors have stated in edit summaries that this paragraph is """"soapboxing,"""" but I don't think that it is. The trial, which has received extensive cover in the media, deals with issues for which BP has already pleaded guilty, and faces fine of up to $20 billion. The presence of other articles is immaterial. This is a very serious trial, and it behooves us to mention it to readers, and state what is at stake. Failure to do so would be a serious NPOV violation, as is the fact that the legal jeopardy that BP faces is not mentioned in the article thanks to the recent edits, an I have so tagged the article.

On the figure, the BP Corporate editor monitoring the article on the talk page here has indicated that other sourcing states that the actual figure of BP's exposure from this trial is really $17 billion, not $ 20 billion. If that can be verified, the figure can be adjusted, but first we need to deal with whether we are going to deal with this in the article at all. Right now we are in the extraordinary position of an article on BP not stating that the U.S. Justice Department is seeking maximal penalties in the billions concerning an issue in which BP has already pleaded guilty to criminal charges.

I copy this from comfort women pages. It contains many references.

Why Korean comfort women during Korean War and why Korean collaborators? Because it is true. It all happened and it was all discuss probably before you were born. So we look to the academics and newspapers for reference.

From, The Construction of US Camptown Prostitution in South Korea: Transformation and Resistance by Lee, Na Young, 2006
 
'The term “comfort women” (wianbu) to refer to military prostitutes serving American soldiers signals the widespread acceptance of camptown prostitution as an inevitable means to entertain foreign soldiers. This term was commonly used in newspaper articles throughout the 1950s along with such phrases as “prostitutes catering to UN soldiers” and terms like yanggongju (Western princesses), or “UN madams” (woman getting a livelihood by serving UN soldiers).129 This usage continued during the 1960s and 1970s when camptown prostitution became more differentiated from non-U.S. military prostitution.  The Korean government’s policy on prostitution reflected its public’s perspectives on prostitution, which was, in the decades after the war, regarded as a necessary means to feed Korea’s impoverished population.'

The Chosun Ilbo or Daily News is major newspapers in South Korea 2,200,000 readers. Examples given are in Chosun Ilbo 23 August, 1960, it mentions, """"In Pup’yLng, some 150 'comfort women dealing with American troops'. Similar reports using the words """"comfort women"""" are: KyLnghyang Ilbo, 11/25/1955; Chosun ilbo, 11/08/1957; Chosun ilbo, 8/23/1960; Chosun ilbo, 12/03/1963. A “Comfort Women’s demonstration” is also reported in 1966. 

In the mid- to late-1960s, there were numerous articles in Chosun ilbo reporting crimes committed against camptown prostitutes by American soldiers that continued to used the term 'comfort women'. Korea college girls recruited for the Nangnang Club were also viewed as """"yanggongju"""" or comfort women (Seoul Sinmun 26 July, 1952; 10 October, 1953). Post-war military brothels were still known as comfort stations and the system based on the Japanese one.

In 1958, the Chosun ilbo also accounts for the number of women involved as 300,000. The women who served “one American husband” were called “yangbuin” (Western madam) instead of the usual """"yanggalbo"""" (western whore) who were generally treated by Korean society as “non-human beings”. Generally, the Yanggongju have been ignored in official Korean histories as a national shame until recent. 

Song-gun Chong in 1967 wrote, 3,000 so-called “comfort women” registered with the  Health Section of the Military and the Military Police Corps of the U.S. Army (“Current Situations of Korean Prostitutes and Countermeasures.” Pophak-nonchong 8:65-87.) 

You can download the main reference at http://www.lib.umd.edu/drum/bitstream/1903/4162/1/umi-umd-3959.pdf

References also arise in Yi, Imha. 2004a. The Korean War and Gende (Hankuk Chonjaengkwa Jaendo). Seoul: Sohaemunjip.

Have you seen The Women Outside: Korean Women and the U.S. Military. Directors J.T. Takagi and Hye Jung Park. 1995. 60 minutes. VHS?

Many of Korean women were also forced, tricked, financial compromised or even kidnapped into sexual slavery for American troops in South Korea. As example, the documentary features Yang Hyang Kim, who """"applied for a job in what she thought was a coffee house, only to be sold to a brothel outside Camp Stanley"""".

Same as Japanese Imperialists before them. They both documents how the Korean and American governments were involved, how Korean officials portrayed the women as “personal ambassadors” fulling their patriotic duty to nation by sexually servicing soldiers. The rape and murder of women by the pimps and the soldiers.

It says. """"Drawing upon interviews and testimonies, emphasize that many of the women who """"serve"""" the US military as so-called voluntary sex workers were in fact recruited in the same brutal ways as were their earlier counterparts in Japan's 'comfort system', that is, through coercion, trickery, and even force - because both Korean and American governmental interests have viewed men's access to female bodies for R & R as so crucial to military morale.""""

Thanks!
for the *. NawlinWiki (talk) 

My pleasure. I think I have to apologize for subjecting you to the diatribe it engendered but, as I think you might agree, it tends to prove the point in an ironic way. I just looked at your talk page and decided that the minor whining *I* get from new page patrol is relatively polite compared to what you seem to have attracted  hence the *. Accounting4Taste:talk  
NalinWiki, you deleted my article while I was still writing it on the basis that it contained """"no references whatsoever"""" but allow your own article to stand even though it contains """"no references whatsoever"""". Please, please explain how your point been proven in """"an ironic way"""". Go ahead. Explain it. All I have seen so far from you is reckless deletion of other people`s work followed by pathetic back-slapping from like-minded wreckers. If you are going to have a dig at me, why not do it on my own talk page? You weren`t shy to destroy four hours of my work, so why be shy now? Kont Dracula (talk) 

I think you've confused the two of us; I must take credit for some statements that have apparently offended you, having signed them, so feel free to express yourself here about them. If you want the contents of an article that was deleted, in order to work on adding citations in a """"sandbox"""" page, you can either ask me or another administrator for assistance. If you have any other questions about Wikipedia policies, I'll be happy to direct you to the relevant pages. And if you'd like to work on contributing to Wikipedia in a worthwhile way, in accordance with our policies, I think everyone here will try to assist you. Accounting4Taste:talk  
No, I haven`t confused anything. There is not very much to confuse between you two drones anyway. I see that you are not very good at answering specific questions about specific articles. Evidently, you feel much safer describing deleted articles that you have not even read as """"steaming crap"""" than you are actually discussing the actual merits of said articles. A really positive, worthwhile contribution there. Is that the kind of """"contribution"""" you want me to make? Hardly surprising that you prefer the classic politburo repsonse of """"directing me to the relevant"""" regulations rather than discuss the merits of the case in question. Yet you have the arch hypocrisy to highlight the """"assume good faith"""" legend on your page.

Well I do have some questions about wikipedia policy, as you mention it:

1) Is it an acceptable practice for a wikipedia adminstrator to delete articles which are in the very process of being written without consultation or clarification on the basis that they do not contain references when the very same administrator has himself posted less relevant articles which do not contain references himself?

2) If the answer to the above is yes (and I have to conclude that it is, as that is precisely what has happened) would it be fair to conclude that wikipedia administrators feel themselves above and not subject to the same criteria for notability and verification as non-administrators? After all, my article contained no references and was deleted. NawlinWiki`s contained no references and was amended when I pointed it out. Please refer me to the relevant pages. Kont Dracula (talk) 

1. Yes, to the first part of the question; administrators can delete articles without consultation or clarification. Articles that are being considered for deletion are assessed entirely on their own terms, and not with reference to any other article, so comparison of your article (which I have read) with any article created or edited by anyone else is not a relevant consideration. You can read the relevant policy at WP:WAX. 
Well I didn`t expect you to be so candid about it. So you believe that it is entirely acceptable for an administrator to completely ignore the very regulations that he is so dogmatically enforcing onto others. You still haven`t referred me to the """"relevant"""" page on that one.

But no, you have not """"read"""" my article because it was in the very process of being written when it was deleted. I am sure that there was a great deal of improvement that it required. There were some slightly whimiscial and humourous details which were possibly not appropriate for a wikipedia entry. It wasn`t perfect. You see, that is why I was editing it and indeed still writing it.

Of course, in reality we know that you have not actually expressed your own opinion. You were pretty forward with your opinion the other day though, weren`t you? You described other people`s articles as """"steaming shit"""". Now though, you are not quite so forward with your opinion. Instead, you try to retreat behind """"guidelines"""" """"r",0,0,0,0,0,0

All these MBT's including the Merkava, can fit aboard the C-5 Galaxy and C-17 Globemaster air transports to be airlifted anywhere on the globe. The Merkava Mk 4 has a 1500hp GD833 Diesel Engine and additional armor, especially up top, for urban battlefields. Ever been to the Holy land? You get all types of terrain there, not the stereotypical desert/arabian landscape that is always seen on TV. There are forests and swamps in Israel, and up north the terrain is especially rough and it snows too. What consensus are you talking about? Israel has had more battlefield experience with the use of armor and armored warfare in general than any country on this planet. The weight of the Merkava Mk 4 is approximately the same as the M1A2SEP. It has more crew protection than the Leopard tank and has an active self-defense system. It also retains the 60mm Mortar which can be fired under armor. BATTLEFILED MOBILITY of the Merkava series of tanks is better than both the M1 and the Leopard. It is true that both tanks are faster than the Merkava but the Merkava was designed with emphasis on crew protection, survivability and firepower, over speed. The Merkava is more survivable in a firepower-saturated environment meaning it can go places the M1 and Leopard cannot. For this reason the Merkava has more freedom to maneuver, which gives more options to it's operators and commanders, and allows more aggressive courses of action. The enemy cannot simply deny areas to the Merkavas by firepower, meaning the Israeli tank has better battlefield mobility than the Abrams and Leo 2.",0,0,0,0,0,0

 legends pertaining to Mucalinda 

I have heard and read from several sources a story which elaborates on the Mucalinda legend.  According to this story, the Buddha was pleased with his protector and blessed him by placing a hand on his hood.  As a sign of the Buddha's blessing, cobras bear his fingerprints on their hoods.  Indian or Spectacled cobras (Naja naja) of course have two ocelli or eyespot markings on the back of their hood.  (These are thought to serve as """"eyes in the back of the head,"""" with the adaptive function of deterring predators that might try to attack the standing cobra from behind).  This story may be told in Thailand also, although there is a slight inconsistency in that Thai cobras (Naja kaouthia) have only one spot. )

I have also heard a variant in which the Buddha was protected by the serpent not from rain storms but from the blazing Indian sun.

Unfortunately, I cannot find a decent source for either of these elements in the Mucalinda story and do not know where they originated. 174.111.242.35  """,0,0,0,0,0,0

A similar case existed in Belarus, but much more amplified, when the changes of 1930s and subsequent orthographic reforms were very noticeable it affected the way whole cities were spelled. Example Minsk and Mensk. In fact that is the reason why there are two versions of Belarusian edition wikipedia, one uses the old and the other the official adopted version. In Ukrainian language a similar happened but to lesser extent, and only some cities were affected e.g. Rivne became Rovno, Luhanske became Luhansk, Konotip became Konotop and so on. With our city as far as I am aware it too became Мукачево. During the 1990s some of those changes were reversed, and it really falls to because in Ukrainian there are sufficient differences between dialects, in fact if you compare western and central Ukrainian the differences would be more vivid than that of British and American English. So for some cases like Rivne, it was much up to the locals, because Volhynian dialect pronounces the city like its spelled, whilst somewhere in Poltava they will say it as Rovno. It seems that with Mukhachevo it is a case that the version used by locals is not entirely adopted nationwide. But then again there are some silly people in the government who use spellings such as Sevatopil but that is outright stupid, because even in classic orthography that version would never be used. The -pil originates from the connotation of field like Ternopil. The -pol comes from the Greek root for city, like Sevastopol.

I'm getting the sense of a double standard for Maryland here. Why is Maryland the focus of this brigade when other state intros are equivalent? I’ve avoided posting in these discussions because it seems you guys are reluctant to seeing the truth and now I have to write a book to get my point across. Even still you will believe what you want to because of personal preference or you don’t “feel it belongs”. Most of all I’m sure you could care less about the state itself otherwise you wouldn’t object. But you want an answer so here it is...

If you think the intro to the Maryland page needs a rework then you have your work cut out for you because you’re going to have to change just about every other state. Case in point, this is the last paragraph from the Commonwealth of Virginia intro, 

 """"Virginia is known as the """"Mother of Presidents"""", because it is the birthplace of eight U.S. presidents (George Washington, Thomas Jefferson, James Madison, James Monroe, William Henry Harrison, John Tyler, Zachary Taylor, and Woodrow Wilson), more than any other state. Most of the United States' early presidents were from the state. Virginia has also been known as the """"Mother of States"""", because portions of the original Colony subsequently became Kentucky, Indiana, Illinois, and West Virginia as well as some portions of Ohio.""""

How is that anymore relevant than proclaiming """"Maryland donated the land for Washington, D.C.""""? Doesn't talk about presidents from decades past and ceding portions of land belong in the History section according to you?

Not convinced? Here’s part of the intro from the State of Wisconsin, this should put your economic fears to rest,

Wisconsin's rural economy was originally based farming (especially dairy), mining, and lumbering. In the 20th century tourism became important, and many people living on former farms commuted to jobs elsewhere. Large-scale industrialization began in the late 19th century in the southeast of the state, with the city of Milwaukee as its major center. In recent decades, service industries, especially medicine and education, have become dominant. Wisconsin's landscape, largely shaped by the Wisconsin glaciation of the last Ice Age, makes the state popular for both tourism and many forms of outdoor recreation.

In previous version they were proclaiming fur trade!!! But it's a sin to proclaim the life sciences which has become the foremost important industry in Maryland right now?

Didn’t get the message? Try the Commonwealth of Massachusetts,

During the 19th century, Massachusetts transformed itself from a mainly agricultural economy to a manufacturing one, making use of its many rivers for power to operate factories for shoes, furniture, and clothing. Its economy declined in the early twentieth century when industry moved south in search of cheaper labor. A revitalization came in the 1970s when, nourished by the graduates of the area's many elite institutions of higher education, the Boston suburbs (particularly those around Route 128) became home to dozens of high-technology companies. Massachusetts' colleges and universities, as well as its technology sectors, continue to thrive.

The state is also considered a haven for progressive, liberal thought and often sends political candidates to the national scene, however, the four most recent presidential aspirants, Ted Kennedy, Michael Dukakis, Paul Tsongas, and John Kerry, were all unsuccessful. . Massachusetts was the home state of US Presidents John Adams, John Quincy Adams, Calvin Coolidge, and John F. Kennedy, and the birth state of George H. W. Bush.
As of 2006, Massachusetts is the only state in the union to legalize marriage of gay and lesbian couples.

Must I continue? It should be clear by now.

If any1 wishes to discuss the issue in detail, please contact me for an explanation. With regard to """"Shuttegod"""" I am in militant disagreement that the previous text he mangled & reduced in his arrogant edit was """"wordy"""" or """"awkward"""", it was a tight, concise very well written opening to the article explaining in essence what the Anglosphere is. What he reduced it to with his edit - with its bombastic egotistical patronising editing note - was weakly written, mushy, vague & illogical at points. Sorry if that's a bit tuff, but it's the truth. The Anglosphere is an increasingly important concept geo-strategically & it's important to get this source for the term right for those who search via Google for an explanation of it. I am open to edits, but they need to augment & improve the opening text, not reduce & state things that are not true, such as """"Eire being a part of the Anglosphere"""" - any1 with the slightest comprehension of the history of Ireland since 1916 can see the fallacy of this view, & whomever holds it does not grasp even the basics of what the Anglosphere actually is!

Plantdrew - Yr edit of the arms programme that militarily links the Anglosphere was useful & interesting, & I left it at 1st, even tho it didn't quite belong in the opening preamble of the article as it was a little too micro & not macro enough for an opening principle description, the reason I edited it out in my scrapping of """"Shuttegod's"""" massacring of the text is that it seemed to be antagonizing him, & it was out of place a little in the opening.

Thanks for uploading Image:BP01.gif. I notice the file's description page currently doesn't specify who created the content, so the copyright status is unclear. If you have not created this file yourself, then there needs to be a justification explaining why we have the right to use it on Wikipedia (see copyright tagging below). If you did not create the file yourself, then you need to specify where it was found, i.e., in most cases link to the website where it was taken from, and the terms of use for content from that page.

If the file also doesn't have a copyright tag, then one should be added. If you created/took the picture, audio, or video then the  tag can be used to release it under the GFDL. If you believe the media meets the criteria at Wikipedia:Fair use, use a tag such as  or one of the other tags listed at Wikipedia:Image copyright tags#Fair_use.  See Wikipedia:Image copyright tags for the full list of copyright tags that you can use.

If you have uploaded other files, consider checking that you have specified their source and tagged them, too. You can find a list of files you have uploaded by following this link.

Seksen the 10,000 turkish-cypriots who were protesting a few months ago (see this) were not protesting against the world (no country imposed any embargoe on North Cyprus). The protests were aimed at Turkey and the imposed austerity measures and the fact that they want to be independent and manage their own affairs. So effectively they feel they're not independent but under occupation (or if you don't like the word, under the """"control"""" of Turkey).  Back to the issue, the Nicosia article should have the same information/structure as the Cyprus article. In fact the the TRNC (or the occupation for that matter) isn't even mentioned in the Cyprus infobox. That's why North Cyprus exists. We have to be consistent. Otherwise what's the point of having North Nicosia? Lefkoşa Distict should be mentioned there. To me it makes sense for Nicosia to represent the RoC (as it officially does) and North Nicosia to represent the TRNC. You can't have both.   """,0,0,0,0,0,0

I was told by the Contact Wikipedia page that one was to either e-mail the administrator who blocked them or contact them on their talk page.

While I do not have an IRC channel, I figured contacting here would be the best way. I am the user currently in charge of the IP address 4.249.108.83, which you blocked. I'm not sure why it was blocked, as I've only used Wikipedia to read entries. The only entry I ever edited was one on Air Force One, and that was to change a mistake of the location of Andrews Air Force Base. As for that edit, it is because I live near the base myself and know the area well. If this is the reason for my banning, then I would say you're two years behind schedule.

What do the three edits Feb. 24 have to do with the sock puppetry investigation of COI from 2006 and early 2007?  This all seems like a big stretch to formulate a grand conspiracy theory where there isn't any. Editors were aware of the COI back when it happened (years ago) and dealt with it.  The article is edited and watched closely now. 

Are the only recent edits those three attempted additions to the Barack Obama article? Hardly a high crime it seems to me.  What you're really upset about is that someone did an unfavorable (but accurate) story about how all attempts to include any mention of controversies or criticisms in the Obama article were reverted. News flash, many of us have had the exact same experience this editor had. If we block users for editing under """"false pretenses"""" so be it, but lots of editors post on other sites about their experiences here. This hardly seems like some grand scheme to bring Wikipedia to its knees.  

This check user investigation, however, and the AfD certainly look like an overeaction that only adds fuel to the fire. Klein said he asked someone to make the edits to see what would happen. He reported on the experience and those he witnessed of other attempts to edit the page that are easily viewed through the history.  This hardly seems like something worth making a federal case over. The only mischaracterization is yours: """"under false pretenses to incite a block and, through off-wiki agitation, bring disrepute on the project and trigger a major meltdown on the Obama page."""" The fact is the editor in question arranged for an attempt to make a reasonable edit to grotesquely biased article and reported on the experience.  That it's not favorable to Wikipedia is certainly cause for reflection and consideration of how we can improve our handling of issues like this in the future.  I know when something messed up is noted on another site and people here are made aware of it there's usually an effort to fix it.  That happened in this case, but the guardians of the Obama page made sure nothing changed.  So be it. If it upsets and embarasses you as it does me, do something to fix it.   """,0,0,0,0,0,0

So  I'm sure you're a really nice guy, but it looks like you're adding the tags not because of the the article needing a cleanup and reorganizing but just because the color scheme of the column boxes are not the color scheme of original boxes and are matching the Roc Nation colors and of the logo.

That is just plain out bias it not my fault that other people do not do this when creating a record label studio album discography, which they can and you have not seen one with a color scheme on them. All I have done is put the 3 basic colors Black, Red and White of Roc Nation on a original Wikipedia column to distinguish it from other record label albums discography and the other names of the artists that are on the article, because the article would grow as those and more artist release more studio albums and mixtapes, which makes it appropriate and not inappropriate as you have stated for you reason of adding cleanup/reorganize tags. Once again all I did is add 3 basic colors to the original columns Black, Red and White which anybody can do on any other record label discographies on Wikipedia, but I may have been the first to do this new color scheme styling of a record label studio album discography that does not mean you just add tags that are not meant to be on a specific article that is formatted, organized and written like any other record label albums discographies on Wikipedia and is fully verified.

 Your POV 

Dear Nlitement,
Unfortunately your point of view is not correct. I won't say it is hypocrisy though, it might be rude... 
I am not, but you are, comparing these two incidents... What I am saying is in these two cases Europian has different standards. I cannot see what is hard for you to see in this? By the way I am not supporting what has happened in some muslim countries. That is wrong too. I do not have double standars...  

 AfD for Firearms (computer game) 

Please consider removing your AfD request for the firearms computer game. It's a highly notable mod: It won PC Gamer's mod of the year, was released on CD from valve, and at one point in time was the #3 most played halflife mod (before DoD came out, and that pushed it back to #4). It's been around for years. I notice from your user page you state you are only 13 years old. Firearms would have been largely before your time. Please see forums.worldatwarmod.com and check the Firearms section for evidence of notability. Thanks.  SWATJester  Ready  Aim  Fire! 

 Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/True Combat: Elite 
As per your comments here, it's obvious you flooded AfD with several mod articles as retaliation for your article being nominated. This is unnacceptable behavior, and if you continue to show such aggression, you may be blocked in the future.  
Call it what you want, the fact is you basically admit to doing it to prove a point in SEVERAL places. Whatever your reasoning for it is, the plain fact is that its against wikipedia policy, no matter how you sugercoat it.  
 Hi 
I would like to ask one person who voted on True Combat: Elite deleting. Do you even play games? Have you even heard about the mod? Have you checked anything about it? Have you seen my phat and big comment where I mentioned a lot of obvious reasons for notability. You don't have to answer. I know the answer.  [talk] 
Since I voted, further evidence of notability has been added so I have changed to a keep vote.  

On the same subject, the article was kept per the afd, but you might want to establish the notability further on the article itself (by including some references to it on notable sites etc.) so that someone else won't just nominate it again in a few weeks. Thanks. -

You are continuing to misrepresent my original objection.  My objection was NOT that 'he didn't respond in 8 hours', or anything like that.  (You portrayed that as my objection, though!).  Instead, I objected that Dodo wasn't addressing MY ACTUAL OBJECTIONS.  Other than his 'driveby deletions', and a template or two, he DIDN'T respond to my complaints.  Not only  did he not address my objections within a day (as you implied my original complaint was), he didn't even EVENTUALLY address my objections!  Irresponsibly, and probably maliciously, you tried to make me look like 'the bad guy' for objecting to Dodo's repeated rapid deletions without waiting for consensus, etc.
Dodo was trying to act on the theory, 'if somebody does ANYTHING even arguably criticizable, I can slap him down repeatedly by deleting his edits, without waiting for any sort of consensus, etc.'  (Evidently, that is your position as well.)  I say, """"No!"""".  Dodo never, in detail, responded to my repeated and DETAILED complaints of his behavior.  Is the reason that 'he is busy'?  Well, if he's SO BUSY, 
why did he have enough time to repeatedly delete my posts?  Doesn't make sense, does it?  The answer is quite simple:  Dodo (and, I suspect, many other self-appointed 'Info-Nazi's' ALWAYS have time to slap down other users (that's EASY, and takes little time!), but they DON'T have enough time to actually defend their own actions when challenged!

What the fuck is your problem. Did you even read what I deleted?

DO you know what the word PLOT means?

Plot does NOT mean talking about the movie's trailer or what genre the movie it is. A plot is a SUMMARY of the movie.

Read what's in the Plot section of """"solaris"""" right now you fucking retard and tell me if it really belongs under the section plot... or any other section. It looks more like trivial facts which are unsupported and should be DELETED as per wiki regulations.
 

Here's an example, dumb fuck, from the solaris wiki page:

""""The film essentially ignores the planet which only serves as an anonymous backdrop, in contrast to Lem's novel which discusses at length the mysterious phenomena on its surface and the futile human attempts to understand them.""""

That is NOT neutrality and has NOTHING to do with the plot.

You've probably missed this but neither Phatius nor I have asserted Esoglou is innocent of the charges.  I haven't looked at your edits in close detail but what I've seen does look troubling and worth a closer look.  I expect Phatius has looked more closely and he seems to think there are some issues with Esoglou's conduct.  It's almost as if we've jumped past the trial and moved to the sentencing phase where Phatius and I are pleading leniency on the basis of redeeming qualities and extenuating circumstances.
As for the focus on LoveMonkey (and I know you disagree with my view on this), my attitude is that if Wikipedia can put up with LoveMonkey, it can put up with ten Esoglous.

Maybe that's the slogan they use now, but there is no doubt the slogan they used back in the day was """"That's why Mum's gone to Iceland"""".  

Still is - I went to an Iceland this morning and this slogan is still plastered everywhere (April 2007)

 Copyright issues 

A lot of this article is directly copied from the Iceland website:
http://www.iceland.co.uk/ice/instore.nsf/(websearch)/theicelandstory
as indicated by the fact that there are still asterisks inserted which do not relate to anything within the article, but rather to notes on the original page. Is it possible that Iceland have approved this copy?  

Almost certainly not. If it was, there'd be some WP:OTRS tag on this page or something else saying that it was legit. As it is I've removed it for its blatancy.  

Name change
It's my understanding that the overall name """"Iceland.co.uk"""" was dropped as a result of the dotcom bubble bursting - the suggestion being that associating a company so totally with t'internet around 2001-2 was stock market poison.
Fair use rationale for Image:Iceland Shop Logo.gif

:Image:Iceland Shop Logo.gif is being used on this article. I notice the image page specifies that the image is being used under fair use but there is no explanation or rationale as to why its use in this Wikipedia article constitutes fair use. In addition to the boilerplate fair use template, you must also write out on the image description page a specific explanation or rationale for why using this image in each article is consistent with fair use.

Please go to the image description page and edit it to include a fair use rationale. Using one of the templates at Wikipedia:Fair use rationale guideline is an easy way to insure that your image is in compliance with Wikipedia policy, but remember that you must complete the template. Do not simply insert a blank template on an image page.

If there is other other fair use media, consider checking that you have specified the fair use rationale on the other images used on this page.  Note that any fair use images uploaded after 4 May, 2006, and lacking such an explanation will be deleted one week after they have been uploaded, as described on criteria for speedy deletion. If you have any questions please ask them at the Media copyright questions page. Thank you. 

 Iceland International Stores 

I started out on this search knowing, without question, that there was an Iceland supermarket on the road between Mijas costa and Mijas pueblo in the Costa del sol in Spain. While merely """"knowing"""" isn't good enough, it does permit of a longer search and of asking the company about non-UK/Ireland stores.  This is what I was sent by email upon asking the company directly through its website:

I can confirm that Iceland do have a number of franchises overseas. However, we do  not hold this information for these stores here. Please feel free therefore to visit www.overseas.es for further information.

I have fixed the internet address from the preceding paragraph to . Click the """"Store Locater"""" tab and, eventually 4 stores in Spain (notwithstanding the text disclaimer at the top of the page referring only to stores in Tenerife) will appear on a map of Spain.

 From User talk:Jimbo Wales I wonder if you might consider...

I wonder if you might consider simply removing your political/religious/etc.  userboxes and asking others to do the same.  This seems to me to be the best way to quickly and easily end the userbox wars.

Userboxes of a political or, more broadly, polemical, nature are bad for the project.  They are attractive to the wrong kinds of people, and they give visitors the wrong idea of what it means to be a Wikipedian.

I think rather than us having to go through a mass deletion (which is what is likely to happen if the userbox fad doesn't go away), it will be better to simply change the culture, one person at a time.  Will you help me? 

 From WikiEN-l [...]

The current situation with these things being in the main Template namespace, and promoted as if healthy and normal in the Wikipedia namespace, is that they are damaging to our culture.  They are attracting the wrong sort of people, and giving newcomers the wrong idea of what it means to be a Wikipedian.

That's why they need to go.  Not to censor people's self-expression, but to make it clear that as a whole the community considers these things to be divisive and inappropriate. Jimmy Wales (jwales at wikia.com)

Sooner or later, they'll all be in GoogleNews/googlebooks; at the very least , for every building erected or planned before 1920. If we're going to hold to the GNG, we have several choices A.  use an increasingly stringent definition of what we consider RSs for WLOCAL  such as requiring regional sources, but that wont have any effect in large cities  B.  Make a special provision about LOCAL requiring more than RSs, such as RSs showing notability in particular ways  C.  Abandon or supplement GNG in favor of distinct criteria that would exclude such articles, such as hotel rating level.  D.   Use combination articles   E.  Accept the articles, but require substantial content F.  Simply accept the articles . G Use a WikipediaTwo or WikipediaLocal project as a supplement to Wikipedia.    

The GNG was originally adopted as a restrictive measure. This is no longer the case. The increase in easily available reliable web information has killed it's usefulness this way. It is now a rule that will increasingly work the other way around. Many deletionists   try to  elevate it into what they consider a basic policy on principles that are not specifically exclusionary, but rely on confusion of WP:N with WP:V ; many deletionists and others think that in principle it is the only logically  defensible way of having a guideline I wonder whether they will stick with it when it yields the opposite result to what they really want, or yield a result that contradicts their own intuition?

What I really want in G, above, a supplement that will maintain WP:V and WP:NPOV and other foundation principles, but not have a WP:N barrier. The inclusionists will be able to get in essentially everything, the deletionists will be able to remove a good bit of borderline content from the present Wikipedia.

 Armenian Genocide 
Peres' denial of the genocide should be noted in this article, failing to do so makes it more of a hagiography than a biography. His shortcomings must also be mentioned in addition to his feats like winning the noble prize. Do you think it'd fit better in political views? In anycase it must, and will, be mentioned somewhere. How about adding this in his political views segment: 

Peres' foreign policy outlook is markedly realist. For example, to placate Turkey, the only significant Muslim country in the region that is friendly towards Israel, Peres has explicity denied the Armenian genocide, which caused an uproar among genocide scholars.(citation)   

Peres made these statements in 2001, when he was foreign minister. Clearly, he was caving in to Turkish pressure. Israel has very few friends and cannot afford to lose them, so basically it is not free to take the position that would seem to mesh with its outlook and history, which is to recognize that the Armenians were murdered en mass. Now he is president, an honorary position, not a political one, and his """"views,"""" whatever they may have been back then, are worth about as much as mine are. I have no problem with mentioning this """"view"""" in the section on his political outlook, but a separate section on this one utterance gives it undue importance and distorts the picture.

Anons concerns cont'd

On the grav-locked, red dwarf planet:

Note that a planet gravitationally locked to its star will have tidal heating like Io, so it's not as if everything will freeze on the night side. The great advantage of a grav-locked planet is its stability. I think it's fair to say that stability is easier for life to deal with than instability. If you look at the stability of Jupiter's great red spot (400 years and posited to be permanent), weather on a grav-locked planet should be relatively stable, I presume a convection rising at the """"sun pole"""" and falling at the """"dark pole"""", with terrain eddies, of course. Such a planet will have no axial tilt, no day/night cycleI don't even think it can have an eccentric orbit, but I'm unsure. This greatly reduces the complexity of an organism's job: for example a plant doesn't need the night """"mode"""" earth plants need; they would not have to drop leaves for winter. These seem like advantages to me.

Based on the best information I can find on the US Dept. of Energy site (solar information), what plants get on a clear equinox day is about 8 kWH/m^2, peaking at 1 kW/m^2. The vast majority of that power comes in the middle 8 hours, less than 1 kWH/m^2 is in morning and evening. The night is essentially 0 kWH/m^2not absolutely, no, but to the 2 digit accuracy I was using, yes. (Compare visual magnitudes of sun vs. moon.) This varies by latitude and season, of course. Now let's plug this into the supposedly horrible 60-200% variation of a red dwarf. Instead of roughly 1/3 time at 1 kW (yes, it really is close to that), equivalent energy would be all the time at 1/3 kW. Thus, the variation would be 1/5 kW during minimums (=60% of 1/3 kW) and, of course, 200% is 2/3 kW. Thus, ignoring frequency, the red dwarf plant has an easier time. The lower power of red dwarfs just pull the HZ in. Considering Earth shade plants, which live on far less than 1 kW/m^2, the HZ is where the total solar and gravitational energy are right for water.

Organizationally, perhaps the best thing would be to treat Earth-like planets in the main flow of the article: then discuss tidally-locked red dwarf planets, with a note that thinking on the issue is in flux; and note that chemosynthsis biospheres would be possible even around brown dwarfs or outlying moons, like Titan and Europa. Perhaps (keeping original numbers):

1 Suitable star systems

 1.1 Spectral class
 3.1 Binary systems (since all but the closest binaries are ok, put it here)
 1.2 A stable habitable zone

2 Planetary characteristics

 2.1 Mass
 1.3/2.2 Acceptable energy variation (as I hope I showed about, """"low"""" isn't really necessary; include the case of Jovian moons in the HZ)
 1.4 High metallicity (it comes from system formation but it's a planet property)
 2.3 Geochemistry (maybe combine with metallicity?)

3 Alternative biologies
 3.2 Red dwarf systems (tidally locked; low light?)
 NEW Chemosynthesis-based biology.

4 on, no changes.

I should add, this is a really good article. Maybe I'm trying to gild the lily.

 Mistake ? 
I am not a specialist but """"Mars, by contrast, is nearly (or perhaps totally) geologically dead and has lost much of its atmosphere [10]."""" (mass paragraph) seems doubtful to me. I mean, Mars still has volcanoes (Mount Olympus for example) so it sees strange to me that it's geologically dead, but once again I am no specialist.  

Mars does have volcanoes, but as far as I know, they're not really active, so nothing is really """"powering them"""" and geological activity isn't really showing up.   
Luna, Earth's Moon has volcanoes, and it's accepted as geologically dead. The presence of volcanoes doesn't mean ACTIVE volcanoes. 
That's basically what I was trying to say, I guess I just never made it really clear.  

 Picture Size 
Can a larger size by found for the Habitability Zone picture? I'd like to use it as a background, but it won't scale up. 

I downloaded it here:  http://library.thinkquest.org though I can't remember the exact spot on the site. An image search for habitable zone turns it up first thing, but only at 19k...  

Earth's geological activity
I am pretty sure that the earth isn't geologically active simply because of its large mass/surface area ratio. From what I have read, I believe that planets are probably heated mostly by radioactive decay, and/or tidal for",0,0,0,0,0,0

Unfortunately, at least in Korea, Japan, and the U.S., most beer includes rice, potato, corn starch, and many other ingredients I think unnecessary. At least they have ingredient lists on the bottles, and there are a lot of official documents on those additional ingredients.
But kimchi is a different story. Like I said, I have never seen any packaged/jarred kimchi labeled """"unfermented"""", maybe except for Japanses """"kimuchi"""" which is more like pickled vegetables. And both traditional and contemporary kimchi is fermented. (they are not much different anyway.) Nevertheless, I am willing to temper my claim if editors can find even a couple of reliable sources that say some kimchi is unfermented.

Possible Original Research:
I only skimmed through on these parts, but it seems to me that most of this needs to be cited - either for verification, or simply for the sake of further reading.

1. French people often refer to Metropolitan France as L'Hexagone (The """"Hexagon"""") because of the geometric shape of its territory.

Unless it was a Frenchman or Frenchwoman who added that in, how can we know for certain that they really do? Is this self-made nickname for that region so internationally renowned that it's a surefire fact? Unless one can respond in the affirmative to either question, It needs a citation.

2. There are various theories as to the origin of the name of the Franks. One is that it is derived from the Proto-Germanic word frankon which translates as javelin or lance as the throwing axe of the Franks was known as a francisca.

Another proposed etymology is that in an ancient Germanic language, Frank means free as opposed to slave. This word still exists in French as franc, it is also used as the translation of """"Frank"""" and to name the local money, until the use of the Euro in the 2000s.

However, rather than the ethnic name of the Franks coming from the word frank, it is also probable that the word is derived from the ethnic name of the Franks, the connection being that only the Franks, as the conquering class, had the status of freemen. In German, France is still called Frankreich, which literally means """"Realm of the Franks"""". In order to distinguish from the Frankish Empire of Charlemagne, Modern France is called Frankreich, while the Frankish Realm is called Frankenreich.

Now here we're talking about cite-cite-cite-for-crying-out-loud-cite! Some of this might not only be original research, but speculation, also! Two Wikipedia-no-nos riddled into one!

Fourth Examination, 17th December, 1455. [Additional statements.] 
The sum of a thousand pounds, or crowns, was given by the King of England for the surrender of the Maid; and an annuity of 300 pounds to the soldier of the Duke of Burgundy who had captured her. 

I was appointed notary in the Trial, together with a certain Guillaume Boisguillaume. 

The copy of the Process was shown to me is the true Copy made. I acknowledge my own and my companion's signatures, and that it is the truth. Two other copies were made. One was given to the Inquisitor, one to the King of England, and one to the Bishop of Beauvais. This Process was made from a certain Minute written in French, by my own hand, which was given up to the Judges, and was afterwards translated from the French into Latin by Monsieur Thomas de Courcelles and myself, in the form in which it now stands, as well and as faithfully as possible, long after the death and execution of Jeanne. As for the Act of Accusation and other parts of the Process, Maitre Thomas de Courcelles had very little to do with these, nor did he greatly interfere with them. 

With regard to the word Nota, written above certain Articles in the Minute, there was, on the first day of the Inquiry, a great tumult in the Chapel of the Castle at Rouen, where, that day, the interrogation was held, so that Jeanne was interrupted at almost every word, while she was speaking of her apparitions: Certain secretaries were there-two or three-of the King of England, who registered, as they chose, her words and depositions, omitting all her defense and all which tended to exonerate her. I complained of this, saying it was irregular, and that I would not be responsible, as clerk, in this matter: and, therefore, on the morrow, the place of meeting was changed and convened in a certain hall of the Castle, near the Great Hall, while two English were placed to keep order. When there were difficulties as to Jeanne's answers, and some said she had not replied as I had written, I wrote Nota at the top, in order that the questions might be repeated and the difficulties removed. Although it is mentioned in the Process that the Judges stated they had received preliminary evidence, I do not remember to have seen or heard of it; but I know that, if it had been produced, it would have been inserted in the Process. 

Jeanne was brought to Rouen and not to Paris, because, as I think, the King of England and the principal people of his Council were there. 

At the beginning of the Process, I was sent for to attend a meeting held at a certain house near the Castle, at which were present the Bishop of Beauvais, the Abbe' of Fecamp, Maitre Nicolas Loyseleur, and many others. The Bishop told me it was necessary that I should serve the King: that they meant to bring a fine case against this said Jeanne, and that I was to recommend another greffier to assist me. I therefore nominated Boisguillaume. 

I met Lohier in the Church, on the day after the Bishop had asked him to give an opinion on the Process, and inquired what he you ght of it. He replied, that the Process was of no value, and could not be maintained, because it was conducted in the Castle and not in a legal court; that it concerned many who were not summoned; that Jeanne had no Counsel: and for many other reasons. He added that, in his opinion, it was their intention to put her to death. 

A certain Maitre Nicolas de Houppeville was summoned to attend the Trial; and was in great danger, because he refused. Maitre Jean Lemaitre, Sub-Inquisitor, delayed as long as possible his attendance at the Trial, and was much vexed at being compelled to attend. 

One day, when Jeanne was being questioned, Jean de Chatillon spoke in her favor, saying that she was not compelled to reply to the question put to her, or to that effect. This much displeased the Bishop of Beauvais and his following, and there was a great tumult at his words. The Bishop ordered him to be quiet, and to let the Judges speak. 

On another occasion, when some one was advising and directing Jeanne on the question of submission to the Church, the Bishop said, """"Hold your tongue, in the devil's name!"""" I do not remember the name of him who was thus spoken to. 

One day, some one, whose name I do not remember, having spoken of Jeanne in a way which did not please the Earl of Stafford, the latter followed him, sword in hand, to some place of sanctuary; and, if they had not told Stafford that that place was sacred, he would have slain him. 

Those who seemed to me most affected [against Jeanne] were Beaupere, Midi, and de Touraine. 

One day, I went with the Bishop of Beauvais and the Earl of Warwick to the prison where Jeanne was, and we found her in irons. It was said that at night she was fastened with iron chains; but I did not see her so fas",0,0,0,0,0,0

I blieve the translation from the press office is very good. For someone who is not German this may not be clear, but the first paragraph states intentions, not facts. In Germany there are still people who physically hurt other people and (very few) state authorities who do not act against this, so I believe using is may be confusing. If you want to do a literal translation, the upper version is closer to the original, while the press office version is closer to the meaning.  

 Diverse errors and unencelopedic context use 

I would like to ask this whole article to be checked through. While most of it seems all right, there are passages that make no sense, lack imporatant information or are plain wrong. Examples: First paragraph of Drafting process is
The outbreak of the racial fanaticism in Germany cost humanity approximately 62 million people, or 2.5% of the world population. About 60% of all casualties were civilians, who died as a result of disease, starvation, genocide (in particular, the Holocaust), massacres; and aerial bombing.
While the numbers may or may not be correct, what is the purpose of this paragraph? The people who died and especially the people who did not die because of the war but because of the Holocaust are very important for the way to Grundgesetz was written. But there is no connection made. The next paragraph does not make reference to this and mentions the necessity to keep history from repeating itself in a much more neutral way. Later on:
Any war could and should be categorised as an """"atrocity"""" but the war that Nazi Germany started brought a scale of atrocity never previously known and the statistics of World War II clearly qualify it, by far, as the most heinous atrocity in all recorded history....
Unverified claim, clearly anti-German. The figures I heard suggest that both Stalin and Mao had a higher death toll than Nazi-Germany. Correct, most of their dead were in their own country, but I do not see how that would make it any better.
...and created thereby in Germany the legal situation within which any association of persons that, by reason of their aims or the behaviour of their members or adherents, seek to undermine or abolish this constitutional order is simply illegal, and which assigns to all Germans the absolute right and duty** to resist any person seeking to undermine or abolish this constitutional order, because this demand makes on the entire German people the memory of the 62 million casualties which brought the outbreak of the racial fanaticism in Hitler’s Germany.
While it is unclear where this text comes from, it does not seem to be a quote. I do not believe that this demand makes on the entire German people the memory of 62 million casualties is something that should be claimed in Wikipedia if it is not a direct or indirect quote of some political, moral or other authority. There is also context missing the the right and duty to resist. Violence by the people is only intended as a last resort and is illegal if there is functional police or military loyal to the consitution to deal with the situation.
Directly below the list with senseless emphasis, there is the claim that the German consitution contains blasphemy. Huh? The preamble contains a direct reference to god, other than that there is a rule that religion and state must not interfere in each others buisiness. I am not seeing any blasphemy there. At that time, Germany was a fairly religious state. To sum it up: I believe there was some editor here that wanted to make modern Germany look bad by applying non neutral wording and some unverified claims. The german version of this article seems much better and (logically) is checked much more often than this one. I suggest either having someone who not only read the whole Grundgesetz, but also has significant political and historical knowlege check this article for further inaccuracies or using the german version, which I believe is often checked by people who know the subject, to check this one through. There should be sources to every claim and despite the atrocities in the third reich, wording should be neutral and the crimes of the Nazis should only be mentioned in a context where it makes sense.

Caucasoid

Is it really necessary to mention that some Uyghurs are fair-skinned and have Caucasoid traits? It sounds a bit like Nazi """"science"""" to me... Luis Rib

Well, they do have such traits. You can phrase it a bit differently if you like.  ]] 02:24, Oct 4, 2004 (UTC)

It wouldn't be necessary if we lived in a world in which race (whether considered a real or constructed category) was irrelevant. Unfortunately, that's not the case. The ethnic characteristics of Uyghurs play an important role in discussions of the relationship between Uyghurs and Han Chinese and thus how """"Chinese"""" Xinjiang is or should be. In order to understand the politics of Uyghur/Chinese relations, it's important to know that these characteristics are commonly discussed.  20:20, 2 February 2006 
(UTC)

Why Caucasoid traits? These traits are probably more Semitic than Caucasoid. 86.166.123.12  

The more we try to parse this issue the thornier it gets. Read the Caucasian race entry in Wikipedia and see if you can find any way to separate Semitic from Caucasoid. The entire concept of race is in dispute, and regardless of how people ordinarily discuss differences, an encyclopedia ought to try to avoid such uninformed hypotheses in its entries. It might be better to describe, for example, a people as having blue eyes and fair skin and lacking the epicanthic fold, as well as being largely Muslim, than to try to categorize them by """"race,"""" and so I'd agree that dropping """"Caucasoid"""" would be smart. After all, much of the European population has at least some Mongolian ancestry, as do Iranians, Turks, Central Asians, and so on - and Uyghurs are certainly included in this distribution regardless of their """"Caucasoid traits."""" And if you go back far enough, I suppose the entire world population has African ancestry. You can see how this can become like an argument about how many angels can dance on the head of a pin, and has no place in an encyclopedia that is trying to be authoritative and factual.

I just happened to stumble across the article, read the first sentence and checked the """"citation"""" for the Western Europe claim (as it was news to me) and was sent to a dead page. I searched """"techno origins"""" and found numerous pages saying Detroit birthed techno and added those cites. The evidence is just flat out contradictory to what some editors (wish to) believe. Honestly I do not care, but if Wikipedia is to be a reliable source, we as a community must be honest with what the facts are, or provide evidence (in citations) for alternate claims. I won't be doing any further edits in this article, I'll leave this one alone, I can sense this could turn ugly real quick, so I leave it to people who care more than I do.

Since August 2010, the underground and aboveground Cheongnyangni stations have been directly transferrable through a transfer passageway, contradicting Peterhansen2032's argument. As a rule of thumb, on transferrable stations on the Seoul Subway, the information is combined into one, even for stations with different names (e.g. Isu Station, Cheonan Station).

 Retired numbers - Peyton Manning removal 

A user, who I've engaged in conversation on their talk page, removed Peyton Manning from the """"Retired numbers"""" section of the article, on the grounds that it's """"assumed"""" though not """"official.""""  My reasoning as posted on said talk page, was that Jim Irsay, the CEO of the Colts, stated pretty firmly that no player will ever wear the number 18 again (http://www.thephinsider.com/2012/3/7/2853459/peyton-manning-press-conference-transcript-2012-free-agency-nfl).

I have posted nothing on the article page as this would presumably be a Conflict of Interest, and have made here suggestions of the way in which the book may be used only because requested - my view remains that it should be done by an editor who does not have COI. I think that now we've moved on from the efforts to exclude a source through (wrong) application of the Notability guidelines we're left with Neutrality of Point of View as the main issue. Wikipedia reports what is out there and a decision to exclude entirely from an article an appropriate source which has a view on much that is in the article (as well as topics the article excludes) appears to be a bias. The idea that the only book of lit crit on Beedle the Bard has nothing whatsoever to add to an encyclopaedia article on the topic is incredible. I don't think COIN is central to the issue as it now stands; rather the central issue is NPV. I think there are wider issues which it would be interesting to discuss - for example had my username not been essentially my real name a post on the talk page a year ago saying """"hi guys, this book exists and has something to say about the article"""" would not have generated this negative discussion. I suggest MedCab is a way forward because it can consider all issues, while COIN considers only one issue and probably one which is not central.   """,0,0,0,0,0,0

About your improvements; good work, in general. I am still feeling lost about the description of Henry Cow's music being 'intense', a change from 'intensities'. Any music can be 'intense' for an aficionado. Me, I think Frith is intense. D ... Something more descriptive is needed.
Regarding the presence of Beppe Colli, I do not see his notability, and the web magazine Clouds and Clocks is not mentioned elsewhere, by other media sources. When I Google """"clouds and clocks"""", I get a 1965 lecture on rationality by Sir Karl Raimund Popper, and I get a children's book on encopresis, the soiling of pants. Similarly, Beppe Colli does not get mentioned elsewhere. The man and the website are not notable.
Applying the same criteria to Babyblaue Seiten and the German reviewer Achim Breiling, I find that Breiling is a medical researcher who has published papers about genes, proteins and cloning, and has written prog rock reviews for the New Gibraltar Encyclopedia of Music in addition to a bunch of them at Babyblaue. CDBaby lists Babyblaue Seiten as a source, and an article exists about that review site in the German Wikipedia. It looks like Breiling in Babyblaue is somewhat more reliable a source than Colli in Clouds. Although Colli's observations are interesting, I cannot see keeping them. It's too bad, because he is the only reviewer who hinted at the CD having some loudness war characteristics, a step down from the dynamic spaciousness of the LP.
About the """"bursts with"""" quote from van Peer, the word 'eradicates' was wrong. Van Peer wrote 'eradiates', which is not a word, but he may have intended this construction as a neologism.

This has been done under section A7 of the criteria for speedy deletion, because the article appears to be about a company or corporation, but it does not indicate how or why the subject is notable: that is, why an article about that subject should be included in an encyclopedia.

The primary goal of the case based textbook is to inform doctors of what to do when they are asked to perform different medical operations. The case based textbook only has one chapter on circumcision. Its primary goal is to inform doctors of how to react in the case they are asked to perform a circumcision. It does not give an overview of questions that have been raised about the procedure, and doesn't cover sources of controversy in the medical field (only debates). This makes it unfit to speak for this topic. Maybe it would be better to use it to highlight another statement involving controversies in the medical field.

The second source titled Controversies with one author is ok, as it does go over some medical controversies that exist, notably in consent and the parental role.

I think a better sourcing for this statement """"Ethical and legal questions regarding informed consent and autonomy have been raised over non-therapeutic neonatal circumcision.[8][9]"""" would be one that highlights significant questions from community groups in a specific demographic. If we could get a source that is clearly indicating that these questions are being raised that would be better.

 feedback as requested 

Hey Antonin! I'm only too happy to help out (as much as I can) - having sooooo many problems elsewhere. In fact, completely and utterly stuck and rather despondent about it all. 

First impressions; not yet a balanced article - a lot on the controversies, too little on the magazine and its background; the latter, I think, needs clarification. What was the Czech political-cultural context, and how did this produce the magazine? """"Conservative"""" is too vague - I think readers will benefit from being told more about Czech conservatism. Then there's the magazine itself; who started it (and what were they doing before this?); editorial policy, contributors, transfer of ownership (if any) and whether or not the magazine has changed since its acquisition by the media group. 

Put it this way: certainly in the UK (and probably in the US), an award for growing the best cannabis plant isn't something usually associated with a conservative magazine...  

I'll put this page on my watch-list. I'll be happy to sort out any copy issues, btw. Best regards,   

Thanks for your opinions, Davey. You are right, the article is not balanced. I'm trying to use only sources independent on the magazine itself, and unfortunately the sources deal mainly with controversies. There is an overview of the history of Reflex in the 20th anniversary issue, I'll try to expand the article with that information and answer your questions. Btw, Reflex is sometimes really considered as a conservative magazine; could there be a little difference between the perception of the term in the professional and well-developed Anglo-American journalism and the perception of still """"young"""" independent Czech journalism? Using of this term in the post-communist world is quite complicated, as conservatism defends traditional values and continuity, and the first free post-communist media (including Reflex) had to start building again; to some extent they had to find the values and the interrupted tradition. The provocative cannabis award could be an attempt to test the borders of freedom of speech and to come closer to independent and bold journalism. This is, however, just my vague point of view. We should probably avoid this association on English Wikipedia, as this is a world grown in a completely different tradition and experience. Again, thanks for pointing out the problems. I'll work on it.   

I've attempted to expand and clarify the origins and background of the magazine as recommended.   

Yes, I've been hovering over your shoulder the whole time! Good beefy stuff... d'you reckon you're pretty much done with the content? 'Cos I do, and intend twiddling up the prose some time this weekend. By the way, it's no big deal but are you OK with all those red-links?   

Hi Davey, you won't believe how happy I am seeing that you are still interested! I'm careful with the red links, this project has still gaps in detailed covering of Czech topics. All of the red linked names are notable Czech journalists. See the Czech wiki articles for Jan Šibík, Petr Hájek, Jiří X. Doležal, Tomáš Feřtek, Josef Klíma, Jiří Pehe, Tomáš Baldýnský, Bohumil Pečinka, Miloš Čermák, Pavlína Wolfová. With the red colour I'm trying to point out that they should have articles also here. Thank you for your help and interest, ask whatever )   

Oh, I know how that one feels. It can be a strange and lonely business indeed. Still, here come the queries:

 Constitution and Editorial continuity: d'you know who owned it in the first place? Was it a one-man show which employed Petr Hájek? Or was he owner and editor? Sorry to be picky here, but it'll matter, particularly as this is living persons biog.
 Yes, the BLP issue is the main reason why I asked for your help. Hájek was the owner, together with Andrej Šťastný and Jiří Fleyberk. He seems to be the most important one, according to my sources.
OK: so the sale of the magazine (over the heads of the editorial board) was entirely legal, despite the resentment. D'you think this was seen as a matter of personal gain and freedom of action (on his part) vs personal responsibility",0,0,0,0,0,0

 News suppressed on Wikipedia http://rexcurry.net/wikipedialies.html 

RexCurry.net is the historian who made the following discoveries covered elsewhere and on Wikipedia:

1. The USA’s first Pledge used a straight-arm salute and it was the origin of the salute of the monstrous National Socialist German Workers' Party (Nazis).  It was not an ancient Roman salute.  http://rexcurry.net/pledgesalute.html

2. The Pledge began with a military salute that then stretched outward toward the flag. Historic photographs are at http://rexcurry.net/pledge2.html and at http://rexcurry.net/pledge_military.html   Due to the way that both gestures were used, the military salute led to the Nazi salute. The Nazi salute is an extended military salute. http://rexcurry.net/book1a1contents-pledge.html

3. The Pledge’s creator was a self-proclaimed socialist in the nationalism movement in the USA and his dogma influenced socialists in Germany, and his Pledge was the origin of their salute. """"Nazi"""" means """"National Socialist German Workers' Party."""" A mnemonic device is the swastika (Hakenkreuz in German).  Although the swastika was an ancient symbol, it was also used sometimes by German National Socialists to represent """"S"""" letters for their """"socialism.""""  Hitler altered his own signature to use the same stylized """"S"""" letter for """"socialist.""""
http://rexcurry.net/book1a1contents-swastika.html

The Pledge is part of the USA’s growing police-state.  The insane government in the U.S. could cause comatose persons to Pledge dis-allegiance, desecrate the flag, and recite a declaration of independence. Remove the Pledge from the flag, remove flags from schools, remove schools from government.

As a libertarian lawyer, Rex Curry provides pro bono services nationwide in schools and elsewhere, to educate the public about the news.

Government schools will never teach children about their Pledge rights, nor the truth about the Pledge and its author.

Most comments fail to ever mention that Francis Bellamy and his cousin Edward Bellamy were National Socialists in the USA, wrote for and supported their """"Nationalist"""" and """"New Nation"""" magazines, the """"Nationalist Educational Association"""" and pushed their totalitarian dogma in their """"Nationalism"""" clubs worldwide, including in Germany, and that the bible of their movement, Edward Bellamy's book """"Looking Backward"""" was translated into every major language including the languages of those countries that became home to totalitarian socialism and the socialist Wholecaust (of which the Holocaust was a part) under the National Socialist German Workers' Party (21 million dead), the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics (62 million dead), and the Peoples' Republic of China (35 million dead).  It is easy to see why anyone would want to cover all of that up, but it should not be covered up.

In the USA, the Bellamy dogma supported a government takeover of education.  The government's schools imposed segregation by law and taught racism as official policy.  The USA's behavior was an example for three decades before the Nazis. As under Nazism, the Jehovah's Witnesses, and blacks and the Jewish and others in the USA attended government schools that dictated segregation, taught racism, and persecuted children who refused to perform the straight-arm salute and robotically chant the Pledge. Some kids were expelled from government schools and had to use the many better alternatives.  There were acts of violence. When Jesse Owens competed in the 1936 Olympics in Germany, his neighbors attended segregated government schools where they saluted the flag with the Nazi salute.  The U.S. practice of official racism even outlasted the horrid party.  And the schools and the Pledge still exist. The Pledge is still the most visible sign of the USA's growing police state.  

After segregation in government's schools ended, the Bellamy legacy caused more police-state racism of forced busing that destroyed communities and neighborhoods and deepened hostilities.

Bellamy was a self-proclaimed national socialist in the USA, with the """"Nationalist"""" magazine, and he preached what he called """"military socialism.""""  The federal flag darkens schools because Bellamy wanted government to take over all schools and to eliminate all of the better alternatives.  Worse, Bellamy wanted the government to take over everything, not just schools. He wanted the government to impose the military system on all of society. School flags are a symbol of  nationalization, militarism, and socialism.

The Bellamy dogma was the same dogma that led to the """"Wholecaust"""" (of which the Holocaust was a part): 62 million killed under the former Union of Soviet Socialist Republics; 35 million under the Peoples' Republic of China; 21 million under the National Socialist German Workers'",0,0,0,0,0,0

I understand you, but you also should understand me. You shouldn't revert my work.

I realy respect your effort and work there, and I don't revert it. I have no desire to get blocked, or to drag you into another blockade. I want to resolve all this disputes with you. As you can see I already changed Template:Politics of Yugoslavia to a neutral, non-image version. These are my proposals to you:

1) If we put in place your version of the list of Yugoslav Prime Ministers, it will remove Drago Marusic as Prime Minister in 1945, between Ivan Subasic and Tito. If you agree to left him on the list, this dispute is over. If we agree about Marusic, we can also agree about the issue """"Kingdom or DF Yugoslavia"""".

2) Federal Republic of Yugoslavia was a complete different state than Serbia and Montenegro. It wasn't like Kingdom of Serbs, Croats and Slovenes and Kingdom of Yugoslavia, or Federal People's Republic of Yugoslavia and Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia. In 2003, after the adoption of the Constitutional Charter, whole system of government was changed. Even the position of the Prime Minister was abolished, and merged with the position of the President. Those two countries realy need a separate articles. Also, their armies need a separate articles.

3) Articles President of the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia and President of Serbia and Montenegro should remain separate. The last President of FRY was Vojislav Kostunica, from 2000 until 2003 when he was replaced by Svetozar Marovic of SCG (2003-2006). Those two offices was very different (President of FRY wasn't both head of state and head of government, like President of SCG). 

4) Prime Minister of the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia wasn't """"Prime Minister of Serbia and Montenegro"""", but of FRY. That article should retain its current name.

5) As you can see, yesterday I changed Template:Politics of Yugoslavia to a neutral, non-image version. I hope that you agree with this version.

As it does not agree with standard translations of that passage, one wonders about the unusual wording - so reminiscent of the odd """"quote"""" you made from the Mahabharata the other day. 

But, more importantly, what about the completely false """"reference"""" to """"The History of Civilizations of Central Asia, Vol. II""""? Why have you (again) not replied to my pointing out of this apparent dishonesty? This is only the most recent in a very long list of false """"quotes"""" and """"references"""" you have made and I have exposed on these pages - as you well know. Now, I am willing to accept that maybe one or two false quotes could be the result of honest mistakes or sloppy research - but when the process is repeated over and over and over again one begins to suspect that the author is doing it deliberately and intends to deceive readers. So, quite naturally, I and others have come to mistrust any quotes you may give - especially to sources that are difficult to check. I am sorry - but you have brought this situation upon yourself.

 Evidence Redux 

I'll be frank.  The blocking of  came a bit late for my taste.  However, he was found to be in violation of the 3 revert rule, and to again quote the policy which ironically Malke was threatening people with and was himself found to be in violation of:

"""" A bright line exists on edit warring, known as the three-revert rule (3RR). If an administrator has not acted already by this point, then action is very likely, especially if a report is made to the noticeboard. Policy forbids edit warring generally, and editors may be blocked if they edit war, with or without breaching 3RR. """"

I commend  for taking the actions he did.  The subsequent complaints Malke made, and his promise to cease his activity in order to get unblocked a few days later, are a matter of record on his user talk page.  Malke has since deleted the notifications, but they are viewable in his talk page history, and make interesting reading.

After Malke's block on August 19, 2009, I decided I needed to take a step back.  For the past ten days I have busied myself with other Wikipedia subjects.  I now return to this page.  I suggest we talk a bit about what happened, and I also suggest we take a look at what happened here this month, edit by edit.  It continues to seem clear to me that Malke was editing with obsession towards an agenda; his obsession got him in hot water with the admins.  Soon, Wikipedia policy is going to change, as many here know.  I'd welcome some reasonable discussion, and renewed work on the article.   

On closer examination of the history pages of the main article, it appears some of Malke's biased edits, through sheer volume, are still in effect.  I propose going through every edit of his, see exactly what changes of his have survived, and put back all relevant, sourced material.  Once that is effected, we can pick up the chore of dealing with further improvements.   

Having just returned to WP from an extended absence, I am not fully familiar with what has occurred with this article, but cursory skimming of the talk page reminds me of some of the frustrations which led me to leave WP more than a year ago. I recognize Malke's concerns. Material that is added back should strictly follow WP:BLP, ie., it should be directly relevant to Rove, not defamatory, and should be sourced by reliable secondary sources.   

Malke's concerns were one thing, his methods another.  Admins blocked him not only due to his violation of the three edit rule, but because he was deleting paragraphs of properly sourced material, and as the admins noted (to quote directly from Malke's talk page history, since he has since, for obvious reasons, deleted all reference to his blocking):

   
   
- *An impartial administrator just did; I don't know you from Adam, and haven't so much as looked at the contents of your edits; all that matters is that you broke WP:3RR, and received a short block for it; if you want to be unblocked, all you have to do is agree to stop edit warring, regardless of whether you think it is justified or not. :==( o ) 

'''I highly commend the admins, and urge others to support their work. These admins had not been involved here previously; they took firm, direct action on a disruptive editor, Malke, who was judged to be making """"untrue"""" statements regarding his efforts.

Wikipedia is hosted in the US, so US laws on copyright, etc. are enforcable. That's just the way it is, and we need to avoid legal action being taken against the foundation. To be honest, I don't see big differences in behaviour of editors by nationality, so far as nationality is apparent - I suspect that there are just more Americans here than any other nationality, simply due to sizes of populations of English-speakers, so any group of editors is likely to have more Americans than anything else, including the helpful, constructive, thoughtful ones. I think, however, that there are a higher proportion of editors here now than ever before who have little interest in adding and improving content, preferring to delete, argue, try to raise the bar on notability and fair use guidelines to allow more to be deleted, etc., but I don't see this as a wholly US phenomenon.  08:15",0,0,0,0,0,0

"fec6961acc20d82e","I have just followed from your edit exchange on the article Blu-Ray Disc to find the exchange above.  Sadly, you appear to know little about the subject, and to be fair, it has become confusing because much of the terminology has become abused.

First, European Blu-Ray discs are not produced in 24p format.   That is almost exclusively the preserve of the American regions.  Secondly, the Blu-Ray format does not support the proper 1080 progressive high definition formats (1080/50p and 1080/60p (and I include the 59.95p in that).  This is because the data rate is not fast enough for these formats.  The European sourced discs that state 1080p on the packaging are discs produced from film originated material and is one of the abuses of the term progressive.  The term progressive strictly defines a video format where the lines of video information are recorded in strict numerical order, 

1 - 2 - 3 - 4 - 5 ... 1078 - 1079 -1080.  

Alternatively, there is the interlaced format which displays the odd lines ony first (odd field) and then follows them by the even lines (even field). (You probably know this already).

1 - 3 - 5 - 7 ... 1077 - 1079 - 2 - 4 - 6 ... 1078 - 1080

They are actually stored in the digital video frame the other way around due to the digital video format's origins in the NTSC world.  In true video source material, the even field displays a time slice that is 20 milliseconds later than the odd field and the two together give a comlete video frame.  This is also largely true in the Americas, except the even field precedes the odd field by ~16.6 miliiseconds.

There is a largish group of enthusiasts (if that's the right word) who have become somewhat anally retentive over the progressive video formats and who have convinced themselves that progressive is the only way to go.  The reality is that any improvement in the visual perception of the video is marginal at best and certainly not worth the doubling of the required digital data to support it.  But for them, everything has to be progressive.  I shall coin the word 'progressivists' for this discussion.

When film originated material is transferred to video in Europe, the film is run slightly fast by 4% which allows one film frame to occupy both the the odd and even fields of the video frame (known as 2:2 pulldown).  Thus the even field displays a time slice that is 0 milliseconds later than the odd field.  In order to satisfy the progressivists, the Blu-Ray producers state that such material is in 1080p format, but using something called a 'Progressive Segmented Frame' technique (though they don't mention that last bit on the box).  That is: that it is progressive video, but the odd lines have been recorded together and then they are followed by the even lines.  It is really interlaced video, but by the time the display device or the Blu-ray player has de-interlaced the video (it doesn't matter one jot where it actually happens), the result is perceptually indistinguishable from true 1080/25p video (assuming the deinterlacing algorithm works properly).  If watched on a CRT display then, of course, the video will be interlaced as there is no deinterlacing prior to display, but with that number of lines, no one is likely to notice (unless they sit inches away from the screen).  The description 1080p on the box is, technically at least, wrong but percetually the same as 1080/25p video.  The 4% speed up goes completely un-noticed especially these days when the sound is adjusted back to the original pitch - and obviously you hadn't noticed it yourself if you had convinced yourself that you were watching films at the original speed.

Once we cross to the Americas, different problems occur.  Obviously, running the film at 30 frames per second is not an option, so instead, film is converted to video by storing the same film frame on 3 half video frames, followed by storing the next frame on 2 half video frames and then repeating 3 - 2 - 3 - 2.  Thus 4 film frames occupy 5 video frames (the technique is 3:2 pulldown - often wrongly called 2:3 pulldown).  Properly deinterlaced, such material is perfectly watchable and the viewer unlikely to feel anything is wrong.  But the progressivists have decided that it is not the way to watch film material and have even invented faults to justify a move to a progressive format.  I have even seen claims (obviously failing to understand the technique) that movement in the resultant video is uneven in that it jumps 50% further every other jump due to the 3 half fields.  

The result was the 24p format.  The only problem with the 24p format is that if you try to watch it on a CRT display (and A CRT is still unbeatable for contrast and colour reproduction), the result will be unviewable to bad flicker - something that was known as long ag",0,0,0,0,0,0

Anyone familiar with newegg knows that it is a top 10 internet retailer in terms of sales, putting it ahead of bestbuy.com, etc.  I believe it is the #2 electronics internet retailer, behind dell.com.  If your products are on newegg (and on the front page of their video card section), you deserve at least a small article on wikipedia.

Unbelievably, eVGA is also marked for deletion: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:EVGA_(Company) ... even though eVGA is a VERY well-known maker of video cards and motherboards.  In the past few years, I'd assume they've sold $30-50 million in video cards annually... and yet people who know nothing about electronics mark it for deletion.

If wikipedia doesn't want sub-10 million in sales corporations to be on it, then I guess Palit may not make the cut, but it seems to me that the notoriety of these companies is mostly called into question by people who don't know a single computer corporation other than Dell, Apple, IBM, and Gateway.",0,0,0,0,0,0

The more viewers I get, will support my case in the court of public opinion and pressure the three involved companies, Chrysler, Compuware d/b/a Professional Services, and Combustion Components to settle my 11 year homelessness.

Search: Corporate Blacklisted engineer

   

I worked as a Mechanical Design Engineer for almost 20 years collectively for the following companies; Pratt and Whitney, Williams International, Ford Motor Company, and as a contract engineer for Compuware d/b/a Professional Services at Chrysler Corporation in Auburn Hills, Mi. It is the latter two to which I am forging my complaint as they told prospective employers, my private investigator and my newspaper reporter, that I was not employed by them, thus blacklisting me, and preventing from all future employment.

 

I believe that they did this to me because I found fault with one of Chrysler’s automotive designs that could have resulted in a safety issue, that they did not want to fix and it was easier and cheaper to get rid of me.

 

I took my case all the way to the Supreme Court in Washington, DC and in Boston’s Federal court ….all courts denied me justice. A lawyer representing Chrysler offered me $1000 to settle the case about 2 years ago which I refused since I felt it was like a slap in the face compared to the injustice they have caused me.

 

Your viewing of my video will greatly help to end my 11 yrs of homelessness by increasing public awareness of my case and consequently, will send Chrysler, Compuware and combustion components a direct message that I am not giving up and refuse to go quietly into the night.

 

Thank you for your time and consideration,

 

Bill Butler

I find it telling that neither of you had the courtesy to respond to my proposal and K3 went ahead to begin editing the article without any consensus being reached. Let the record note that I am now compelled to reciprocate your actions and make my suggested changes. JJ obviously lacks any serious knowledge in this area and was only here for circumventing 3RR, so there's no point answering his most recent underinformed questions. I'll focus on Kautilya3. If you were significantly acquainted with the topic, you would understand that the Kakatiyas were feudatories of the Eastern Chalukya dynasty.So the question of when the formal royal dynasty began is a natural question, not """"patent nonsense"""", and probably one of the reasons some previous editor changed the old date to """"Uncertain"""". 1053 was the date given for the first royal inscription based on the permanent grant of Hanumakonda (their original capital for your edification) as a fief to the Kakatiyas. I also suggest you both refresh your knowledge of WP:Civility, to improve the quality of your current and future discussions. If you don't know about an author, here's a hint, ask...politely..rather than first disrespectfully dismissing the author, then demanding his c.v. What's more, his book speaks for itself. Its the History and Culture of Andhra Pradesh (the old state which included the new state of Telangana). This is not some arcane ivory tower speculative paper, but a WP:RS. So if you want to change the date to 956CE, perfectly fine by me. The only difference is, I had the sense of responsibility to provide a citation. I suggest you do the same. 

Let me repeat that I am perfectly fine with having a respectful dialogue. But as I've said before, it takes two hands to clap. Ball is in your court, gentlemen.

 Auto guides and the motoring press are not good sources for an encyclopedia article about """"luxury vehicle"""". This is because automakers feed the press a lot of BS (Boastful Superlatives) who then work hard to write articles adding even more BS to describe their products. The press earns credits from the hands that feed them. Add to this the fact that potential and actual purchasers of luxury vehicles have an insatiable  appetite  for this type of BS. Classifying a particular vehicle as """"luxury"""" is also designed to easily make it superior to other vehicles even if the differences are superficial.
